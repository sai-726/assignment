Assignment - 1: Data Preparation and Understanding

Data Preparation and Understanding Through XML Processing, Image Cropping, Resizing, and Histogram Comparison

Project Overview:
This project focuses on XML processing, image manipulation, and various image processing techniques using scikit-image. Key functionalities include converting images to grayscale, plotting grayscale images with corresponding pixel intensity histograms, applying the Sobel edge filter, calculating edge histograms, and performing histogram comparisons using different metrics. Additionally, it implements Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) feature descriptors and dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Processing XML:
The project begins by processing XML files to extract relevant data. The xml_processor.py module is responsible for parsing XML files, extracting information, and preparing it for subsequent image processing steps.

Image Manipulation:
Cropping and Resizing Images: Within the image_processor.py module, functions for manipulating images facilitate cropping and resizing to ensure uniform input data for processing.
Conversion to Grayscale: The scikit-image library is employed to convert images to grayscale, simplifying color information and enhancing processing efficiency. Grayscale images are adept at capturing features essential for image analysis tasks.

Sobel Edge Filtering: Grayscale images undergo Sobel edge filtering to accentuate edges and contours, providing valuable information about the structure and boundaries within the images.
Calculation of Edge Histograms: Edge histograms are computed for each image, capturing the distribution of edge intensities. These histograms serve as features for further analysis and comparison.

Comparison of Histograms:
The histogram_comparison.py module employs three distinct metrics for histogram comparison:
1. Euclidean Distance: Measures the straight-line distance between two histograms, providing a measure of dissimilarity.
2. Manhattan Distance (L1 Norm or City Block Distance): Involves summing differences between corresponding values in two histograms, offering a perspective on dissimilarity.
3. Cosine Distance: Measures the cosine of the angle between two histograms, providing a normalized measure of similarity.

Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) Features:
Utilize the hog_descriptor.py module to compute HOG features for each image. HOG is a technique used for object detection and image recognition, capturing information about gradient orientation distribution.

Dimensionality Reduction using PCA:
Efficient data handling with crucial information preservation is achieved through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The pca_reduction.py module facilitates dimensionality reduction.
All processed images, histograms, and comparison results are stored in the results/ directory. Visual representations such as plots and output images aid users in comprehending the effects of processing steps on
input images.
